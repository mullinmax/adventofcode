<h2>--- Day 3: Binary Diagnostic ---</h2><p>The submarine has been making some <span title="Turns out oceans are heavy.">odd creaking noises</span>, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.</p>
<p>The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine. The first parameter to check is the <em>power consumption</em>.</p>
<p>You need to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate two new binary numbers (called the <em>gamma rate</em> and the <em>epsilon rate</em>). The power consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by the epsilon rate.</p>
<p>Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the <em>most common bit in the corresponding position</em> of all numbers in the diagnostic report. For example, given the following diagnostic report:</p>
<pre><code>00100
11110
10110
10111
10101
01111
00111
11100
10000
11001
00010
01010
</code></pre>
<p>Considering only the first bit of each number, there are five <code>0</code> bits and seven <code>1</code> bits. Since the most common bit is <code>1</code>, the first bit of the gamma rate is <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>The most common second bit of the numbers in the diagnostic report is <code>0</code>, so the second bit of the gamma rate is <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>The most common value of the third, fourth, and fifth bits are <code>1</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>0</code>, respectively, and so the final three bits of the gamma rate are <code>110</code>.</p>
<p>So, the gamma rate is the binary number <code>10110</code>, or <code><em>22</em></code> in decimal.</p>
<p>The epsilon rate is calculated in a similar way; rather than use the most common bit, the least common bit from each position is used. So, the epsilon rate is <code>01001</code>, or <code><em>9</em></code> in decimal. Multiplying the gamma rate (<code>22</code>) by the epsilon rate (<code>9</code>) produces the power consumption, <code><em>198</em></code>.</p>
<p>Use the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the gamma rate and epsilon rate, then multiply them together. <em>What is the power consumption of the submarine?</em> (Be sure to represent your answer in decimal, not binary.)</p>
Make sure you read the prompt carefully and understand it fully. The program should output a single number as a solution. Write a python 3.10 program with comments that solves the problem:
with open('data.txt') as f: #open file
  data = f.readlines() #read each line
  gamma_rate = '' #initialize gamma rate string
  epsilon_rate = '' #initialize epsilon rate string
  for i in range(len(data[0])): #loop through each column
    ones = 0 #number of ones
    zeroes = 0 #number of zeroes
    for line in data: #loop through each line
      if line[i] == '1': #if the character is 1, increment ones
        ones += 1
      else: #if the character is 0, increment zeroes
        zeroes += 1
    if ones > zeroes: #if more ones than zeroes, add 1 to gamma rate
      gamma_rate += '1'
    else: #if more zeroes than ones, add 0 to gamma rate
      gamma_rate += '0'
    if ones < zeroes: #if more zeroes than ones, add 1 to epsilon rate
      epsilon_rate += '1'
    else: #if more ones than zeroes, add 0 to epsilon rate
      epsilon_rate += '0'
  gamma_rate = int(gamma_rate,2) #convert gamma rate to int
  epsilon_rate = int(epsilon_rate,2) #convert epsilon rate to int
  power_consumption = gamma_rate * epsilon_rate #calculate power consumption
  print(power_consumption) #print power consumption

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/mnt/adventofcode/2021/3/gpt_program.py", line 9, in <module>
    if line[i] == '1': #if the character is 1, increment ones
IndexError: string index out of range

Write a version of the code with the issue above fixed
