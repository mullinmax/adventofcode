Prompt: 
Given a 3D grid of x,y,z coordinates, calculate the surface area of the scanned lava droplet by counting the number of sides of each cube that are not immediately connected to another cube.

Example: 
2,2,2
1,2,2
3,2,2
2,1,2
2,3,2
2,2,1
2,2,3
2,2,4
2,2,6
1,2,5
3,2,5
2,1,5
2,3,5
Surface area: 64 

Outline: 
1. Create a function to calculate the surface area of the scanned lava droplet 
    a. Create a list to store the x,y,z coordinates of each cube 
    b. Create a variable to store the surface area 
    c. Iterate through the list of cubes 
    d. For each cube in the list: 
        i. Calculate the distance between it and each other cube 
        ii. If the distance is equal to 1, then add 1 to the surface area variable 
    e. Return the surface area variable 
2. Call the function with the list of x,y,z coordinates as an argument 
3. Print the result
Write a Python 3.10 program that solves the above problem, your code should print just the solution and nothing else:

import sys
with open(sys.argv[1]) as f:
