Simplified prompt:

Write a program to calculate the signal strength of the X register during the 20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th cycles. 

Example: 
In the following program, the signal strength during the 20th cycle is 420 (20 x 21), during the 60th cycle is 1140 (60 x 19), during the 100th cycle is 1800 (100 x 18), during the 140th cycle is 2940 (140 x 21), during the 180th cycle is 2880 (180 x 16), and during the 220th cycle is 3960 (220 x 18).

  Outline: 

  1. Read in the program as an array of strings. 

  2. Create an empty array to store each instruction and its value. 

  3. Iterate through the array of strings and split each instruction into its command and value (e.g. 'add 15' into ['add', 15]). 

  4. Push each command and value into the empty array. 

  5. Create a variable to keep track of the cycles and set it to 0. 

  6. Create a variable to store the value of X register and set it to 1. 

  7. Iterate through the array of commands and values and: 

      a. If command is 'noop', increment the cycles variable by 1. 

      b. If command is 'add', increment the cycles variable by 2 and add the value to X register. 

  8. Check if the cycles variable is equal to 20, 60, 100, 140, 180 or 220. 

  9. If so, store the signal strength (cycles * X register) in a separate array. 

 10. Calculate the sum of the signal strengths stored in the separate array and print it out.
