Distilled Prompt:
Given a list of sensors and their closest beacons, determine how many positions in a row cannot contain a beacon. 

Example: 
Sensor at x=2, y=18: closest beacon is at x=-2, y=15
Sensor at x=9, y=16: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16

In the row where y=10, there are 26 positions where a beacon cannot be present. 

Problem:
In the row where y=2000000, how many positions cannot contain a beacon? 

Outline: 
1. Parse input and create a list of sensor positions and their closest beacons 
2. Create a set of coordinates in the given row (y=2000000) 
3. Iterate over the list of sensor positions and their closest beacons 
4. For each sensor, determine if the beacon is in the given row (y=2000000) 
5. If the beacon is not in the given row, add all positions between the sensor and beacon to the set of coordinates 
6. Count the number of coordinates in the set 
7. Output the count of coordinates
Write a Python 3.10 program that solves the above problem, your code should print just the solution and nothing else:
