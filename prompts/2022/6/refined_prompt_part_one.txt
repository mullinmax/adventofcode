## Summary

We need to write a program to detect the first position in a data stream buffer where the four most recently received characters are all different. This position is known as the start-of-packet marker.

## Examples
- `mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb`: first marker after character `5`
- `nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg`: first marker after character `6`
- `nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg`: first marker after character `10`
- `zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw`: first marker after character `11`

## Outline
1. Accept the data stream buffer as an input.
2. Iterate through the data stream buffer one character at a time.
3. For each character, store the last four characters in a separate array or list.
4. Check if all the characters in the array are different.
5. If all characters are different, return the position of the first character in the array. 
6. If all characters are not different, continue to the next character in the data stream buffer. 
7. Repeat steps 2-6 until the start-of-packet marker is found.
Write a Python 3.10 program that solves the above problem, your code should output a single integer and nothing else:

import sys
with open(sys.argv[1]) as f:
