## Problem Summary

The Elves have given us a device with a communication system that needs to detect the start of a packet (four distinct characters) and a start of a message (fourteen distinct characters). We need to write a program that will identify the first position of the start-of-message marker in the datastream buffer.

### Examples
- `mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb`: first marker after character `19`
- `bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz`: first marker after character `23`
- `nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg`: first marker after character `23`
- `nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg`: first marker after character `29`
- `zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw`: first marker after character `26`

### Outline
1. Create a function that takes in a string as a parameter
2. Create a for loop that loops through each character in the string 
3. Create an if statement that checks if the last 14 characters of the string contain 14 distinct characters 
4. If the statement is true, return the index of the 14th character 
5. Else, continue looping through the string
Write a Python 3.10 program that solves the above problem, your code should output a single integer and nothing else:

import sys
with open(sys.argv[1]) as f:
