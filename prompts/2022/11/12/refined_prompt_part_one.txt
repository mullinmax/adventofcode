Distilled Prompt:
Given a grid of lowercase letters (a-z) representing elevations, find the shortest path from the start position (S) to the end position (E).

Outline:
1. Read in the heightmap of the grid from the puzzle input.
2. Create an empty path array and a visited array to keep track of visited squares.
3. Set the current position to S.
4. Calculate all adjacent squares to the current position and store them in an array.
5. Calculate the elevation of each adjacent square and store it in a separate array.
6. Find the lowest elevation of the adjacent squares and move to that square.
7. Add the new position to the path array and the visited array.
8. If the new position is E, stop and return the path array.
9. Else, set the new position as the current position and go back to step 4.
Write a Python 3.10 program that solves the above problem, your code should print just the solution and nothing else:
